# C-Game-Created-2018-
A little text-based C game I created in a week during the summer of 2018. It is text-based, because of the limits with my knowledge in C. The player can create an avatar, choose their class and go off to fight randomly-generated enemies. Each fight takes a point of fatigue, determined by the stats of the created player. When there are no fatigue points remaining, the player must rest at an inn, for which he pays with gold, dropped by enemies. The gold can also be used to buy new equipment - armor and weapons. The project is far from finished and polished, but this is the version in which i abandoned it.
